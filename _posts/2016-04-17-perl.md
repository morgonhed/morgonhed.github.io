Perl is my favourite language, so I'll probably be posting about it.

But for now I am just testing syntax highlighting...

```perl
my $a = "Hello world";
print "$a\n";
```

The way to do this is to format the code like this:

    ```perl
    my $a = "Hello world";
    print "$a\n";
    ```

Easy enough...
